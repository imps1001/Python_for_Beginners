--> Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
--> A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
--> In Python, tuples are written with round brackets.
    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

--> The elements of the tuple can be accessed using indexing.
--> Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
--> Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
--> When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
--> Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
--> Allow Duplicates : Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value.
        
    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")

--> To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function
    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

--> You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:
        thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
        print(thistuple[1])

-> Negative indexing means start from the end.
    -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

--> Range of Indexes- You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start    and  where to end the range.
    - When specifying a range, the return value will be a new tuple with the specified items.
    - thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
    - print(thistuple[2:5])

--> To determine if a specified item is present in a tuple use the in keyword:
        thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
        if "apple" in thistuple:
            print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits tuple")
